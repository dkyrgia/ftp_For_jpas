# ftp_For_jpas
A Python program I made to download jpa files (Akeeba backup, a Joomla extension creates such files). Akeeba only holds 3 jpa's no matter how many backups you get. So I found it easier to dowlnload all of them to my local directory any time I like. It can be altered to download any files you like. 
The reason of its existence is to added in a cron job (or smth like this) to automate backup from a remote server.
